<h1>Private Advertising Technology Community Group Charter</h1>
</header>

<h2 id=mission>Mission</h2>

<p>The mission of the <a href=https://patcg.github.io/>Private Advertising
Technology Community Group</a>, motivated by the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/>W3C TAG
Ethical Web Principles</a>, is to incubate web features and APIs that
support advertising while acting in the interests of users, in particular
providing strong privacy assurances.

<p>The group welcomes participation from browser vendors, advertisers,
publishers, ad buyers, advertising platforms and intermediaries, privacy
advocates, web application developers, and other interested parties.


<h2 id=scope>Scope</h2>

<p>The Community Group will incubate new web platform features intended to be
implemented in browsers or similar user agents.  The purpose of these features
is to support web advertising and provide users with privacy guarantees with a
strong technical basis.

<p>The Community Group may consider designs that allow user agents for the same
user &mdash; including non-browser agents, like Operating Systems &mdash; to
collaborate in providing advertising features.

<p>The Community Group will develop and document a set of common
principles by which proposed private advertising features can
be assessed, with respect to the Web Platform Design Principles, including the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">priority
of constituencies</a>.

<p>Initially, the Community Group will also develop a charter for a
<a href=https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/>Working Group</a> with similar scope. This
working group shall provide a venue for formal standardization of work that this
Community Group incubates.


<h3 id=out-of-scope>Out of Scope</h3>

<p>Features that support advertising but provide privacy by means that are
primarily non-technical should be proposed elsewhere.


<h2 id=work>Work</h2>

<p>The primary artifacts of the Community Group will be technical specifications of
capabilities that support advertising while implementing the web platform's
responsibility to act in the interests of users, including preserving privacy.
These technical specifications will be developed in preparation for standardization
in other groups.

<p>The Community Group will also develop the initial Privacy Advertising
Technology WG charter and a document for Privacy Principles for Web Advertising
Features.

<p>The Community Group will record their <a href=#consensus>consensus</a> in
documents.  The Community Group may choose to formally <a href=#adopt>adopt</a> a
document with the intent of producing a
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/#deliverables>Community Group
Report</a>.

<p><a href=#chairs>Chairs</a> appoint <a href=#editors>Editors</a> for
adopted documents.

<p>The current work of the Community Group includes the following
documents:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name
      <th>Editors
      <th>Expected Outcome
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr id=wgcharter>
      <td><a>Private Advertising Technology Working Group Charter</a>
      <td><a>Chairs</a>
      <td>WG Formation
    </tr>
    <tr id=principles>
      <td><a>Privacy Principles for Web Advertising Features</a>
      <td><a>Robin Berjon</a>
      <td>Internal CG Use
    </tr>
    <tr id=threat-model>
      <td><a>Threat Model</a>
      <td><a>Erik Taubeneck, Charlie Harrison, Martin Thomson, Chris Wood</a>
      <td>Internal CG Use
   </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This list will be kept <a href=#amendments>updated</a> by the Chairs.

<p>Documents for new features will be accompanied by use cases and any
additional test data.


<h2 id=features>Feature Work</h2>

<p>The Community Group will seek to develop a shared understanding of
new features.  In addition to improvements to feature design, the
Community Group will seek to gain
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#implementation-experience">implementation
experience</a> with features through experimentation.

<p>The Community Group is not a standardization body.  Once a feature
reaches sufficient maturity, the Community Group will seek to find a
venue for standardization of the feature.  It is expected that migration
will occur by the time that features are ready for widespread deployment.
Migrating work to a standardization venue will only be done with
agreement from that venue.

<p>Work on migrated work will continue exclusively at the chosen venue and
Community Group activities on that work will cease.  Documents could become
standalone specifications in other groups or some contents could be integrated
into one or more existing specifications.

<p>Experience with features might lead to Community Group Participants
concluding that the work is no longer likely to be successful.  Work on
adopted features can be discontinued if the <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a>
conclude that there is no longer <a href=#consensus>consensus</a> to
continue that work.

<p>Repositories and documents related to discontinued work will be
modified to make their status clear and may be archived.

<h3 id=adopt>Document Adoption</h3>

<p>Community Group Participants may propose that the Community Group adopt
a document.  The <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a> then seek to determine
whether the document is <a href=#scope>in scope</a> for the Community Group and if
there is <a href=#consensus>consensus</a> amongst Community
Group Participants that the work should be taken on and that the document is a good basis for a Community
Group Report.

<p>For adoption of documents that include new features, Community Group
Participants also need to reach consensus that the features:

<ul>
<li>address a genuine need for web users, for creators of
 advertising-supported websites, for advertisers, or to support an existing need that may
 be impaired by advancing privacy properties;
<li>provides or could provide acceptable privacy properties for users;
<li>provides an acceptable web experience for users; and
<li>further work is likely to lead to independent interoperable
implementations.
</ul>

This judgment should be guided by documented and agreed principles.

<p>The Community Group will adopt a document that records the principles by
which features are judged.  During development of this document, the principles
it contains might not have consensus.  The Community Group will seek consensus
on principles and clearly distinguish which principles have attained consensus.
These advertising-specific principles will be based on or reference work in the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/>Privacy Interest Group (PING)</a> and
<a href=https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/>Technical Architecture
Group (TAG)</a> that defines generic principles.

<p>The Community Group prioritizes its time on adopted work.

<p>Chairs may provide resources, such as repositories, for potential new work or
work that is related to the mission of the Community Group.

<h3 id="individual-draft-management">Individual Draft Management</h3>

<p>Individuals or entities may bring relevant proposals to PATCG.
PATCG will set up and maintain <a
href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts">a separate space</a> with <a
href="https://github.com/patcg/proposals" title="PATCG Proposals
Repository">name and instructions defined in the proposals repository</a>. Any
individual W3C or PATCG member may bring a proposal to that space with the
understanding it will be governed by W3C rules and the <a
href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/>W3C Community
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. The proposal should also have a notice
on the `README.md` file at its base or on the document itself which clearly
states "This document is an individual draft proposal. It has not been
adopted by the Private Advertising Technology Community Group."</p>

<p>The document's author or <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a> may propose that the
Community Group consider if a document in the space is potentially in scope. The
<a href=#chairs>Chairs</a> then shall determine whether the document is <a
href=#scope>in scope</a> for the Community Group and if so 
it will be added to a list of relevant proposals for the community group's work
<a href="https://github.com/patcg/proposals" title="PATCG Proposals repository">in the PATCG proposals repository</a>
and create a repository under the individual contribution space.
If the chairs determine the proposal is not in scope, its author will be requested
to move it to a different venue.
Documents which are determined to no longer be potentially in scope may
be removed by chairs.
</p>

<p>The Community Group may facilitate but will not prioritize meeting time for documents in the draft space.

<h2 id=process>Process</h2>

<p>The group operates under the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/>Community and
Business Group Process</a>. This Charter is the sole operational
agreement of the Community Group. Terms in this Charter that conflict
with those of the Community and Business Group Process, the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/>Community
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>, or the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/final/>Final
Specification Agreement</a> are void.

<p>All work and communication within this group is covered by the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/>W3C Code of Ethics and
Professional Conduct</a>.

<p>Contributions to the work of the Community Group can only be made by
Community Group Participants who have agreed to the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/>W3C Community
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.


<h2 id=chairs>Chairs</h2>

<p>The <dfn>Chairs</dfn> of the Private Advertising Technology Community Group are:

<ul>
<li>Aram Zucker-Scharff
<li>Sean Turner
</ul>

<p>The Chairs are responsible for the day-to-day running of the group,
including:

<ul>
<li>appointing <a href=#editors>Editors</a> for documents,
<li>ensuring the group adheres to its <a href=#process>Process</a>,
<li>adjudging the <a href=#consensus>consensus</a> of the Community
Group as needed,
<li>encouraging participation,
<li>moderating discussions,
<li>running <a href=#meetings>meetings</a>,
<li>managing the group resources,
<li>maintenance of this Charter.
</ul>

<p>The Chairs have a number of other powers and responsibilities which
are defined throughout this document.

<p>No two Chairs can be from the same organization.


<h3 id=chair-selection>Chair Selection</h3>

<p>Within the above constraints, additional Chairs may be appointed by
unanimous consent of the then-current Chairs.

<p>Chairs are added by election if the number of Chairs is reduced below two.
Alternatively, if five Community Group Participants &mdash; no two from the same
organization &mdash; call for an election, and no election has taken place in
the previous three months, then an election is held to select two Chairs in place
of all existing chairs.

<p>The group must use the following process to elect Chairs with a goal of
increasing the number of Chairs to two.  The Community Group shall consult the
Community Development Lead on election operations (e.g., voting infrastructure
and using <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3797>RFC 3797</a>):

<ol>
<li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days
to announce their candidacies. No two candidates can be from the same
organization.
<li>If the number of candidates is less than or equal to the number of
vacancies, those candidates become Chairs.
<li>If there are more candidates than vacancies, there is a vote.
<li>If there are no candidates and no remaining chairs, the Community
Group will be dissolved.
<li>Participants vote by selecting a single candidate. Multiple
Participants from the same organization collectively share one
vote. Participants have 21 days to vote.
<li>Vacancies are filled by candidates with the most votes.
<li>Tied votes are resolved by random selection from tied candidates
using the process in
<a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3797>RFC 3797</a>.
</ol>

<p>Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.

<p class=note>The Community Development Lead is a member of W3C staff
chosen by W3C leadership to manage the Community Groups program. As of
the drafting of this charter, the Community Development Lead was
<a href=https://www.w3.org/People/functions/w3m#dom>Dominique
Hazaël-Massieux</a>.


<h2 id=editors>Editors</h3>

<p>Chairs appoint <dfn>Editors</dfn> to maintain <a href=#adopt>documents</a>.
Editors are responsible for the technical content of documents and are
responsible for maintaining documents.

<p>Editors are responsible for
<ul>
<li>ensuring that technical content of documents accurately represents Community
Group <a href=#consensus>consensus</a>,
<li>resolving conflicts between contributors,
<li>finding resolutions to open issues,
<li>helping to manage the corresponding tests,
<li>ensuring concordance of documentation and implementation of features
(the “don’t write fiction” rule),
and
<li>ensuring contributions are only made by Community Group Participants
who have agreed to the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/>W3C Community
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
</ul>

<p>Editors are empowered to make decisions based on their own assessment
of the <a href=#consensus>consensus</a> of Community Group
Participants.  <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a> can override Editor decisions
on <a href=#appeals>appeal</a>.

<p>Editors have discretion in how they manage updates to documents,
provided they adhere to the requirements of this charter.

<p>Editors have discretion regarding editorial aspects of documents. Changes
that are purely editorial in nature can be made, accepted, or rejected by
editors. Editors are encouraged to seek Community Group input or consensus on
changes.


<h2 id=work-mode>Work Mode</h2>

<p>The group generally conducts its work in public.

<p>Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the
GitHub repository the group is using for the particular document. This
might be in the form of a pull request, by raising an issue, or by
adding a comment to an existing issue or pull request.

<p>This group practices responsible disclosure of security and privacy
vulnerabilities in our work. The Chairs will ensure that instructions
for reporting security or privacy issues are
<a href=https://patcg.github.io/SECURITY.html>posted on GitHub</a> and
kept up-to-date.


<h3 id=meetings>Meetings</h4>

<p>The Community Group may hold teleconferences and face-to-face
meetings. The <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a> will determine the schedule,
logistics, and agenda of each, in consultation
with <a href=#editors>Editors</a> and Community Group Participants.

<p>Chairs should <a href=#notices>notify the group</a> for meetings
allowing at least one week notice for teleconferences and four weeks
notice for face-to-face meetings.

<p>Minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be
<a href=https://patcg.github.io/patcg/meetings>archived</a> for public
review.

<p class=note>Conclusions reached in meetings are tentative; see
the <a href=#decisions>Decision Policy</a>.


<h3 id=decisions>Decision Policy</h3>

Decisions are made with the <a href=#consensus>consensus</a> of the
Community Group.  Decisions regarding the Community Group charter and
the set of Community Group documents are adjudged
by <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a>.

<p>Decisions regarding the contents of documents are adjudged
by <a href=#editors>Editors</a>, with oversight by Chairs.

<p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
conclusions reached in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference are
tentative, and will be recorded in the relevant issues, pull requests,
or repositories for consideration by Community Group Participants. Any
Community Group Participant may object to a decision reached at a
face-to-face meeting or teleconference within 14 days of publication of
the decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for
their objection. Editors will facilitate discussion to try to resolve
objections.

<p>In case of a conflict among Community Group Participants, Editors and
Chairs are expected to go to significant lengths to resolve
disagreements and address legitimate concerns. Seeking consensus is not
obligated if the concerns raised are not consistent with this charter or
agreed principles.

<p>If a Community Group Participant is not satisfied with the resolution
of an issue, they may request that the Editors revisit the issue. If not
satisfied with the Editors’ final response, Community Group Participants
may <a href=#appeals>appeal to the Chairs</a>.

<p>It is the Chairs’ responsibility to ensure that the decision process
is fair and does not unreasonably favor or discriminate against any
Community Group Participant or organization.

<p>The Chairs may override Editors’ decisions, or remove Editors.

<p>Implementations can always override decisions by implementing
something else. Whenever that happens a breakdown in communication has
taken place that the Community Group should seek to overcome and find
ways to prevent it from happening again.

<p>Features should not make references to or rely on specific browser
engine implementation details.


<h4 id=consensus>Consensus</h4>

The Community Group operates by rough consensus.  Within the Community Group,
<a href=#chairs>Chairs</a> are ultimately responsible for adjudging the
consensus of Community Group Participants.  Chair decisions regarding
consensus are final.

<p>This charter defines consensus as being equivalent to rough consensus as
defined in <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7282>RFC 7282</a>.

<p>Rough consensus does not require unanimous agreement.  Using rough consensus
recognizes the potential for there to be some disagreement with decisions.
Rough consensus prioritizes progress over seeking full agreement, allowing a
decision to be reached over objections if those objection are heard, understood,
and recognized.

<p class=note>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Process-20200915/#Consensus">W3C
definition of consensus</a> is consistent with this, but unsuitable for use in a
Community Group due to the integration of
the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Process-20200915/#FormalObjection">Formal
Objection</a> process and procedural aspects specific to the operation of W3C
Working Groups.


<h4 id=appeals>Appeals</h4>

<p>Community Group Participants may raise substantive issues for
resolution by the <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a>.

<p>To raise an issue on a decision, a Community Group Participant must:

<ol>
<li>identify the issue clearly (technical problem, interoperability
issue, inconsistency with the mission of this charter, inconsistency
with agreed principles, etc...),
<li>recommend a solution,
<li>post the issue for review in the Work Item’s repository, and
<li>attempt to resolve the issue with the Editors or other Community
Group Participants.
</ol>

<p>If the Community Group Participant finds the outcome of their efforts
unsatisfactory, they may appeal by summarizing the issue and their
efforts to resolve it. An appeal is then sent to the Chairs with any
supporting information.  Appellants must forward a copy of their appeal
to the Community Group by opening the appeal as a GitHub Issue on the Community Group GitHub administrative repository.

<p>Upon receiving an appeal, the Chairs review the request.  Chairs may
then seek further information or initiate discussion in the Community
Group in order to inform their decision.

<p>Chairs should seek to produce a timely resolution to appeals that is
based on the <a href=#consensus>consensus</a> of the Community Group.
Once resolved, Chairs <a href=#notices>notify the group</a> of their
decision.  Chair decisions on appeals are final.


<h3 id=notices>Announcements</h3>

<p>When the Chairs are required to <dfn>notify the group</dfn> of
something, they are required to provide written communication in the
form of an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/patcg/">
Community Group GitHub repositories</a>. All issues and pull requests
posted to those repositories are automatically sent to the Community
Group's mailing list, public-patcg@w3.org, that all members are subscribed
to upon joining the Community Group; refer to the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/patcg/" target="_blank">PATCG community page</a> for information to join.

<p>Chairs must provide notice at the next
available <a href=#meetings>meeting</a> time.




<h2 id=coordination>Coordination</h2>

<p>This group will collaborate with appropriate groups at
<a href=https://www.w3.org/><abbr title="World Wide Web
Consortium">W3C</abbr></a>, <a href=https://whatwg.org/><abbr title="Web
Hypertext Application Technology Working Group">WHATWG</abbr></a>,
<a href=https://www.ecma-international.org/>Ecma</a>,
<a href=https://ietf.org/><abbr title="Internet Engineering Task
Force">IETF</abbr></a>, and elsewhere, and will
migrate <a href=#work>new features</a> to the appropriate body when
there is agreement that the work is ready for standardization. Groups
most likely to be close partners are listed below, but this group is
expected to coordinate with other groups.

<h3 id="wg-coordination">Engaging Stakeholders for Working Group</h3>

At any time, but always when a specification is undergoing a state change, the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/" title="W3C Working Groups">WG</a> will
ask <a href="https://patcg.github.io/">PATCG</a> for feedback. The WG will allow the CG at least 4 weeks to gather
that feedback.

<h3 id=w3c-coordination>W3C Groups</h3>

<dl>
<dt><a href=https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/>Privacy Interest Group
(PING)</a>
<dd>This Community Group will coordinate with PING on the development of
principles that will guide the development of advertising capabilities.

<dt><a href=https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/>Web Application Security
Working Group (WebAppSec)</a>
<dd>WebAppSec is both a potential venue for standardization of
security-related capabilities and a source of expertise on web privacy.

<dt><a href=https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webapps>Web Applications
Working Group (WebApps)</a>
<dd>WebApps is a potential venue for standardization of new features.

<dt><a href=https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/>Web Platform Incubator
Community Group (WICG)</a>
<dd>WICG is expected to be a major source of Proposals for this group.

<dt><a href=https://www.w3.org/community/web-adv/>Improving Web Advertising
Business Group (WebAdv)</a>
<dd>Proposals discussed in WebAdv, but not yet adopted by other Community
Groups are expected to be a source of Proposals for this group. Additionally,
WebAdv has been documenting use cases that advertisers on the web rely on
which can inform discussion in this group. Finally, Proposals which are
advertising related but do not fit within the scope of this group may be
redirected from this group to WebAdv.

<dt><a href=https://privacycg.github.io/>Privacy Community Group</a>
<dd>The Privacy Community Group is developing privacy-focused features.  Some
coordination will be needed to ensure that the work of the two groups is not in
conflict.

</dl>

<h3 id=external-coordination>External Organizations</h3>

<dl>
<dt><a href=https://whatwg.org/>Web Hypertext Application Technology
Working Group (WHATWG)</a>
<dd>WHATWG is a likely venue for standardization of new features.  In
particular, WHATWG standards include
<a href=https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/>core web platform
infrastructure</a> upon which new advertising features could be built.

<dt><a href=https://ietf.org/>IETF</a> working groups
<dd>A number of IETF working groups are likely venues for
standardization of protocol components that advertising features depend
on.

</dl>


<h2 id=patentpolicy>Patent Policy</h2>

<p>As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
commitments under the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/> W3C
Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request
to participate without representing their organization’s legal
interests, W3C will in general approve those requests for this group
with the following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an
organizational commitment under the CLA starting with the individual’s
first request to make a contribution to the work of the Community Group.


<h2 id=antitrustandcompetition>Antitrust and Competition</h2>

<p>Participants in this Community Group shall follow the <a href=https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2017/antitrust-guidance>W3C Antitrust and Competition Guidance</a>.


<h2 id=licensing>Licensing</h2>

<p>Work Items of this Community Group will use the
<a href=http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document>W3C
Software and Document License</a> or a license compatible with the
standards body that is expected to eventually adopt the work.  The W3C
Software and Document License will be assumed unless an alternative
license is identified.

<p class=example title="Example: HTML Pull Request">If a feature
includes parts that are expected to end up as a pull request on the
<a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org>HTML Living Standard</a>, that part
should be licensed under the

<p><a href=#chairs>Chairs</a> are responsible for maintenance of this charter.

<p>Chairs must ensure that the published version includes an accurate record of
current, <a href=#work>adopted documents</a> and
the <a href=#editors>Editors</a> of those documents.

<p>Other amendments to this charter are the responsibility of Chairs,
based on the <a href=#consensus>consensus</a> of Community Group
Participants.

<p>Chairs must <a href=#notices>notify the group</a> of any material
changes to the Charter, per the
